# Character Entropy Budgets
# Defines cliché tolerance modifiers per character archetype
#
# This file operationalizes the SFE concept that different characters
# should have different tolerance levels based on their role and voice.
#
# Usage Formula:
#   effective_tolerance = scene_profile.cliche_tolerance × character.base_tolerance_modifier × stress_modifier
#
# Example:
#   breezy_dialogue (0.3) × comic_sidekick (2.5) × calm (1.0) = 0.75 effective tolerance
#   high_entropy_action (0.0) × protagonist (1.0) × panicked (2.0) = 0.0 (strict stays strict)

character_archetypes:

  protagonist:
    base_tolerance_modifier: 1.0
    description: "Standard tolerance - internal thoughts should feel original and specific"
    stress_modifiers:
      calm: 1.0
      stressed: 1.5
      panicked: 2.0
    notes: "Even under stress, protagonist prose should aim for specificity"

  love_interest:
    base_tolerance_modifier: 1.0
    description: "Standard tolerance - matches protagonist for balanced POV chapters"
    stress_modifiers:
      calm: 1.0
      stressed: 1.5
      panicked: 2.0
      vulnerable: 1.3
    notes: "Vulnerability state allows slightly more familiar phrasing for emotional accessibility"

  comic_sidekick:
    base_tolerance_modifier: 2.5
    description: "High tolerance - their voice IS linguistic inertia; clichés are characterization"
    stress_modifiers:
      calm: 1.0
      stressed: 1.2
      panicked: 1.5
    notes: "Prefab language is part of their charm; let them speak in familiar patterns"

  naive_newcomer:
    base_tolerance_modifier: 1.8
    description: "Elevated tolerance - inexperience manifests as conventional thinking/speaking"
    stress_modifiers:
      calm: 1.0
      stressed: 1.3
      panicked: 1.8
    notes: "Their journey is from cliché to specificity as they grow"

  villain:
    base_tolerance_modifier: 1.5
    description: "Stylized tolerance - theatrical villainy can use familiar dramatic beats"
    stress_modifiers:
      calm: 1.0
      confident: 0.8
      monologuing: 2.0
      defeated: 1.5
    notes: "Monologuing state permits dramatic clichés; confident state demands precision"

  mentor:
    base_tolerance_modifier: 0.8
    description: "Lower tolerance - wisdom should sound earned and specific, not fortune-cookie"
    stress_modifiers:
      calm: 1.0
      teaching: 0.7
      stressed: 1.2
    notes: "Teaching moments require the highest specificity"

  authority_figure:
    base_tolerance_modifier: 1.2
    description: "Slightly elevated - professional/institutional language is inherently formulaic"
    stress_modifiers:
      calm: 1.0
      official: 1.5
      off_duty: 0.9
    notes: "Official capacity allows bureaucratic phrasing; off-duty requires more personality"

  minor_character:
    base_tolerance_modifier: 1.5
    description: "Elevated tolerance - brief appearances don't require deep voice investment"
    stress_modifiers:
      calm: 1.0
      stressed: 1.3
    notes: "Economy of characterization; let them serve their function without over-engineering"

# Voice Rigidity Levels
# Used in conjunction with entropy profiles to determine how much a character's
# voice can flex vs. must remain consistent
voice_rigidity:

  high:
    description: "Character has a strongly defined voice that must be preserved"
    tolerance_ceiling: 0.5
    examples: ["protagonist", "love_interest", "mentor"]
    notes: "Even with modifiers, never exceed 0.5 effective tolerance"

  medium:
    description: "Character voice is defined but can flex for dramatic moments"
    tolerance_ceiling: 0.75
    examples: ["villain", "authority_figure", "naive_newcomer"]
    notes: "Ceiling allows more range while maintaining recognizability"

  low:
    description: "Character voice is loose, defined more by role than specific patterns"
    tolerance_ceiling: 1.0
    examples: ["comic_sidekick", "minor_character"]
    notes: "No ceiling - let the scene profile and stress state drive tolerance"

# Context Modifiers
# Additional situational adjustments beyond character archetype

  internal_monologue:
    modifier: 0.8
    description: "Thoughts should be more specific than speech"

  action_sequence:
    modifier: 0.7
