# Entropy Profiles - Narrative Heat Maps
# This file defines the "Temperature" settings for different scene types.
#
# CHARACTER-AWARE TOLERANCE:
# These base tolerances can be modified by character archetypes.
# See character_entropy_budgets.yaml for character-specific modifiers.
#
# Formula:
#   effective_tolerance = profile.cliche_tolerance × character.modifier × stress.modifier × context.modifier
#
# Example:
#   breezy_dialogue (0.3) × comic_sidekick (2.5) × calm (1.0) × dialogue (1.3) = 0.975 effective tolerance
#   high_entropy_action (0.0) × protagonist (1.0) × panicked (2.0) × action (0.7) = 0.0 (strict stays strict)

profiles:
  high_entropy_action:
    description: "Maximum chaos. Disrupted syntax. High sensory overload."

    cliche_tolerance: "Strict (0.0)"
    required_lenses: ["somatics", "thermodynamics"]
    banned_words: ["suddenly", "then", "next"]

  deep_pov_reflection:
    description: "Internal monologue. Slow time. High metaphor density."
    sentence_length_variance: "Medium"
    cliche_tolerance: "Strict (0.0)"
    required_lenses: ["acoustics", "tactile_micro"]
    
  breezy_dialogue:
    description: "Fast-paced banter. Lower density."
    sentence_length_variance: "Low"
    cliche_tolerance: "Moderate (0.3)"
