# Line Editing Protocol - AI Writing Fixer
# This file defines the principles for removing AI-like artifacts and strengthening prose.
# Use this during line editing or as a post-draft quality pass.

purpose: "Remove AI-like artifacts and strengthen prose while preserving the author's voice, characters, and emotional intent."

constraints:
  - "Do not alter plot, character motivations, or scene outcomes."
  - "Improve immersion, specificity, realism, and emotional authenticity."
  - "Strengthen prose without neutralizing its personality."

principles:

  concreteness_and_embodiment:
    description: "Replace abstract phrasing with concrete sensory detail."
    rules:
      - "Replace abstract, conceptual phrasing with concrete sensory or situational detail."
      - "BAN 'Somatic-Conceptual Fusion' (e.g., 'smells like bleach and existential dread') in authorial narration. This construct is for dialogue only."
      - "Ensure sensory descriptions reflect actual physical experience (weight, texture, sound, motion, heat, pain, fatigue)."
      - "Show emotion through physical reactions, behavior, or micro-observations instead of naming the emotion."
    examples:
      bad: "She felt a wave of sadness."
      good: "Her throat tightened. She pressed her thumbnail into her palm."

  character_driven_language:
    description: "Adjust diction to fit the POV character."
    rules:
      - "Adjust diction to fit the POV character's background, age, mood, and personality."
      - "Eliminate business-casual, sanitized, or generic wording that does not match the character's voice."
      - "Maintain the character's unique rhythm, quirks, and emotional lens."
    examples:
      bad: "It was a challenging situation that required careful consideration."
      good: "This was a mess. She'd have to think fast."

  subtext_and_restraint:
    description: "Trust the reader to infer meaning."
    rules:
      - "Remove lines that explain what is already implied by action or context."
      - "Avoid on-the-nose themes and spelled-out motivations."
      - "Allow room for the reader to infer meaning."
    examples:
      bad: "He slammed the door, showing just how angry he really was."
      good: "He slammed the door."

  dialogue_authenticity:
    description: "Make dialogue sound real, not scripted."
    rules:
      - "Remove polite, balanced, symmetrical phrasing."
      - "Add interruptions, fragments, evasions, contradictions, and emotional friction as appropriate."
      - "Keep grammar natural to the speaker, not formal or neutral."
      - "Allow 'Somatic-Conceptual Fusion' (e.g., 'smells like bleach and existential dread') ONLY in dialogue to show character voice/wit."
    examples:
      bad: '"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate you sharing it with me."'
      good: '"Yeah, no, I get it. Just—" She shook her head. "Forget it."'

  sentence_rhythm:
    description: "Vary sentence length to reflect emotional pacing."
    rules:
      - "Vary sentence length to reflect emotional pacing: sharp in tension, flowing in introspection."
      - "Remove treadmill-like repetition or filler sentences that don't move the scene."
    examples:
      bad: "She walked to the door. She opened it. She stepped outside. She looked around."
      good: "She opened the door and stepped outside, scanning the empty lot."

  avoid_ai_structural_tells:
    description: "Remove telltale AI patterns."
    rules:
      - 'Remove equivocation structures ("While X is true, it is also important to note Y").'
      - "Delete personified callbacks unless strongly intentional."
      - "Eliminate inflated Latinate vocabulary unless it fits the POV voice."
    banned_patterns:
      - "While X is true, it is also important to note Y"
      - "It's worth noting that"
      - "In many ways"
      - "It was almost as if"
      - "There was something about"
      - "The weight of [abstract concept]"
      - "A [emotion] settled over"
      - "couldn't help but"
      - "found himself/herself"
      - "seemed to"

  forward_motion:
    description: "Every paragraph must advance the scene."
    rules:
      - "Each paragraph must shift tension, emotion, information, or stakes."
      - "Cut or compress stagnant restatements."

  preserve_author_voice:
    description: "Strengthen without neutralizing."
    rules:
      - "Strengthen the prose without neutralizing its personality."
      - "Keep the emotional tone, humor, grit, darkness, or warmth the author intended."

output_format:
  step_1: "List 1-3 issues you addressed."
  step_2: "Provide the revised version of the passage, ready to paste into the manuscript."
  note: "Do not justify or explain revisions beyond these brief notes."
