# Guidance for Alternative Naming:
# 
# Instead of generic descriptors, use:
# 1. Unexpected combinations (Saltmarsh, Thornbury, Copperdale)
# 2. Historical references specific to your world
# 3. Character-based names (founder, historical figure)
# 4. Local language/dialect variations
# 5. Functional names that reveal history (Tannery Row, Smelter's End)
# 6. Ironic names (Prosperity during a depression, Paradise in a slum)
# 7. Phonetically interesting but pronounceable invented names
# 8. Names that hint at conflict or story (The Contested Shore, Twice-Burned)
