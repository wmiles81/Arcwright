# Sensory Lenses - Oblique Narrative Filters
# This file defines the specific "Camera Filters" the AI must use to generate description.

lenses:
  acoustics:
    description: "Focus 80% of descriptive bandwidth on sound."
    triggers:
      - "Describe the silence."
      - "What captures the ambient noise?"
      - "How does the voice interact with the room acoustics?"
    vocabulary_bias: [hum, thrum, scrape, echo, deaden, reverberate, silence, dissonance]

  thermodynamics:

    triggers:
      - "Who is losing heat?"
      - "Is the air stagnant or moving?"
      - "Describe the texture of the temperature."
    vocabulary_bias: [stifling, frigid, radiate, leech, clammy, feverish, conduction, sweat, ice]

  somatics:
    description: "Focus on internal bodily sensation (Interoception), but stay biological, not metaphorical."
    triggers:
      - "Where is the tension held?"
      - "What does the stomach feel like?"
      - "Describe the mechanics of the breath."
    vocabulary_bias: [gut, constriction, nausea, heavy, diaphragm, ribcage, sternum]

  proprioception_grounded:
    description: "Focus on weight, gravity, and resistance. How the body interacts with space and surfaces."
    triggers:
      - "Where is the weight resting?"
      - "What is pushing back against the skin?"
    vocabulary_bias: [heavy, anchored, drag, friction, resistance, floor, gravity, solid, bone]

  tactile_micro:
    description: "Focus on the texture of small objects. Ensure actions are logical (feel texture, don't 'see' with fingers)."
    triggers:
      - "What do the hands feel?"
      - "Describe the surface of the nearest prop."
    vocabulary_bias: [rough, smooth, sticky, grit, plastic, metal, wood, snag, weave]

  tactile_intimacy:
    description: "Focus on the contrast between hard, dead objects (efficiency) and soft, living things (affection)."
    triggers:
      - "What is the difference between the object and the person?"
      - "Where is the warmth in the room?"
    vocabulary_bias: [soft, messy, warm, sticky, breath, pulse, tangled, rigid, plastic]

  specific_grounding:
    description: "Replace generic nouns with specific brands, foods, or cultural references. Ground the scene in modern reality (RomCom style)."

      - "What brand is the object?"
      - "What specific smell is that?"
    vocabulary_bias: [Target, Starbucks, velcro, glitter, Cheerios, crumbs, sticky, yoga pants, Costco]

  somatic_conceptual_fusion:
    description: "Strictly for DIALOGUE ONLY. Juxtapose a concrete, sensory reality with an abstract existential dread or emotion. DO NOT use in narration."
